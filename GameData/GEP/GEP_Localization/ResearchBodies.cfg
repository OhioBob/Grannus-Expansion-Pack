		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Taranis = Astronomers are startled to discover a new planet buried deep within the bright glare of nearby Grannus. Taranis, you couldn't hide forever!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Toutatis = This isn't the biggest or brightness object we've found, nor the smallest or dimmest. Definitely a new planet. We introduce Toutatis.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Nodens = That newly found point of light has all the characteristics of a new planet. Could it be? Yes it is! Let's welcome Nodens to the family of known planets.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Belisama = One point of light orbiting another point of light, must be a moon. This one orbits a planet in the Goldilocks zone, and we're naming it Belisama.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Sucellus = This newly discovered flicker of light looks rather small, but orbits like a planet. It's kind of like a dwarf planet. Intriguing.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Caireen = This incredibly faint object must be either really small or really dark. It is there nonetheless, a new moon to add to the list.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Sirona = That steady point of light observed orbiting Grannus can be nothing short of a new planet. This one appears large, likely a gas giant. We have christened her Sirona.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Airmed = Airmed peaks her head around what appears to be another body. She tries to hide but can't escape the sensitive eye of our most advanced electronic sensors.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Borvo = A pale orange light is spied orbiting what appears to be another body. The name Borvo is added to the list of celestial bodies populating the Grannus system.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Damona = It wasn't easy to spot, but the faint light of the small moon Damona is tracked making repeated circuits of the what appears to be another giant planet.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Epona = What, another planet? The roster just keeps growing ever larger. After some debate, the Astronomical Union has decided to name this one Epona.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Rosmerta = We weren't certain any moons existed this far from Grannus, but the discovery of tiny Rosmerta confirms at least one moon orbits an outer planet.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_RAB-58E = After initial reports of its sighting were dismissed, astronomers now agree the elusive speck is a moon. Until we think of a name we're dubbing it RAB-58E.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Cernunnos = Spotting faint Cernunnos has taken the difficult task of planet hunting to a new level. This one must be really far away, and tiny, and... well, you get the idea.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Grannus = Historians have record of a red light called Grannus, that opened wide at us nearly 2000 years ago and then retreated. They could do with a less lofty vocabulary... But maybe they were talking about this star here.
