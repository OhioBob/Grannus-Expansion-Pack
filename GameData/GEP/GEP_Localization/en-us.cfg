		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Airmed.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Airmed_displayName = Airmed^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Airmed_description = The innermost moon of Sirona, Airmed has lived a violent life that has left it battered and scarred. And what's with the weird two-toned surface? Despite its oddities, Airmed is the best place to be if you want to gaze back at its impressive parent planet. Just be sure to bring a camera.

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Belisama.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Belisama_displayName = Belisama^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Belisama_description = Belisama is the lone moon of the planet Nodens, with an orbit that barely fits inside the small sphere of influence. A lesser body would have likely escaped Nodens's clutches eons ago, but massive Belisama clings so tightly to its parent that the two are mutually tidally locked, each always showing the same face to the other.

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Brovo.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Brovo_displayName = Brovo^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Brovo_description = The second and largest moon of Sirona, Brovo is big enough to be a planet in its own right. Having a substantial atmosphere, and a surface colored in browns and beiges, it leaves us wondering whether Brovo is a rocky and dusty world, or a frozen world covered in ice. Or perhaps something unimagined?

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Caireen.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Caireen_displayName = Caireen^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Caireen_description = A surprise to its discoverers, tiny Caireen is evidence that even dwarf planets can have moons. Almost certainly a captured asteroid, Caireen is now locked in a close and unending orbit of its adopted parent, Sucellus.

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Cernunnos.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Cernunnos_displayName = Cernunnos^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Cernunnos_description = Falling short of planet status, Cernunnos is officially classified a dwarf planet. It is an icy world orbiting far from the warmth of its sun. Is it alone in this part of space, or is it only the largest of a family of small bodies orbiting on the outskirts of this planetary system?

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Damona.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Damona_displayName = Damona^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Damona_description = Damona is the smallest and most distant moon of the planet Sirona. It is a gray and pockmarked world, having one prominent feature that betrays a violent episode in Damona’s distant past.  It's likely a barren orb, but could Damona surprise us?

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Epona.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Epona_displayName = Epona^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Epona_description = Epona is a sizeable planet located in a part of space distant enough from its red dwarf sun that little light and heat reaches this far. While Epona almost certainly has a frozen exterior, does a warm geologically active heart beat beneath its icy crust? And if so, could that warm, wet interior provide an environment conducive for life?
			
		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Grannus.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Grannus_displayName = Grannus^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Grannus0_description = As long as Kerbalkind has known the light they have known about a red glimmer that hung in the sky and to this day dances with the Sun and Kerbin. They have always found it irresistible to point lenses at and use in stories. One great question has been asked through time, though. Is Grannus the sole holder of a barren system, or like everything else around the Sun, is it also a bearer of great surprises?
		#LOC_Bodies_Grannus1_description =  Among the billions of stars in the local galaxy, Grannus at first appears to be nothing special. It is the most common type of star, a red dwarf, making it neither large, nor bright, nor impressive in any way. But to an intelligent race of beings, the Kerbals, living on a rocky planet 2.5 million kilometers away, it is the sole provider of life-giving energy. This indeed makes Grannus a very special star.

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Nodens.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Nodens_displayName = Nodens^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Nodens0_description = Nodens is a large terrestrial planet right smack in the middle of its star's Goldilocks zone. Likely having a thick atmosphere, and possibly liquid water on its surface, Nodens could be an ideal habitat for life. But just how commonplace is life? Will we find a world teeming with flora and fauna, or will it disappoint by being bleak and lifeless? This gem is undoubtedly near the top of any list of places to visit.
		#LOC_Bodies_Nodens1_description = Nodens is a large terrestrial planet with a think warm atmosphere and expansive oceans. It is the ideal habitat for life, and home world of the Kerbals. While Kerbals are industrially and technologically advanced, they make every effort to ensure that the ecological balance of their world is not disturbed. Much of the planet remains an untouched wilderness.

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/RAB-58E.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_RAB-58E_displayName = RAB-58E^N
		#LOC_Bodies_RAB-58E_description = RAB-58E is a small moonlet orbiting on the edge of Epona space. Its unusual orbit suggests that it may be a captured body, but where did it come from? Is it a tiny rock or a frozen snowball? Until we can get a closer look, it's anyone's guess.

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Rosmerta.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Rosmerta_displayName = Rosmerta^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Rosmerta_description = Rosmerta is the inner moon of the planet Epona. Small, frigid, airless, and, in all likelihood, lifeless, Rosmerta doesn't exactly sound like prime real estate.  But she seems rather lonely and ignored, so perhaps we should pay the lady a visit.

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Sirona.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Sirona_displayName = Sirona^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Sirona0_description = While relatively small as far as gas giants go, Sirona is the undisputed boss of her planetary neighborhood. Her disc reflects enough of Grannus' light toward Gael that her existence has been known ever since the first modern telescopes were turned in her direction. Always the faithful companion to Grannus, Sirona never strays far from his warm embrace. Her faint light can be seen moving to and fro in a never ending dance.
		#LOC_Bodies_Sirona1_description = While relatively small as far as gas giants go, Sirona is the undisputed boss of her planetary neighborhood. Shining brightly in Nodens' nighttime sky, Sirona's existence has been known to Kerbals since ancient times. Once worshipped as a deity, Sirona is now the subject of intensive scientific study.

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Sucellus.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Sucellus_displayName = Sucellus^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Sucellus_description = Not quite a planet, but many times larger than the rocky asteroids with which it shares its orbit, Sucellus is something in between. There is speculation this planetary dwarf could be rich in metal and mineral resources, but only by going there will we know for sure.

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Taranis.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Taranis_displayName = Taranis^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Taranis_description = Taranis is a rocky planet orbiting very close to its parent star. Its two hemispheres stand in stark contrast; the sun baked side hot enough to melt rock, the other side frozen in perpetual darkness. Any encounter with this tiny world is certain to be a high-speed affair. If you plan to stay be sure to pack plenty of delta-v, as well as sunblock.

		//GEP/GEP_Bodies/Toutatis.cfg

		#LOC_Bodies_Toutatis_displayName = Toutatis^N
		#LOC_Bodies_Toutatis0_description = The second largest of the inner rocky planets, Toutatis looks like it might be an interesting place to visit. It is a fire and ice world, with one side forever baked by the heat of its sun, and the other shrouded in cold darkness. Between these extremes could lie a comfort zone, though the thin atmosphere isn't likely to afford much protection.
		#LOC_Bodies_Toutatis1_description = The nearest of the inner rocky planets, Toutatis is an inviting target for interplanetary travelers. It is a fire and ice world, with one side forever baked by the heat of its sun, and the other shrouded in cold darkness. Between these extremes could lie a comfort zone, though the thin atmosphere isn't likely to afford much protection.
